Scripts to produce synthetic data for demos

This is a collection of scripts to produce synthetic data for demos. This repo borns from synthetic_producer repo, but hardcoding the values and randomizing the data at the same time the data still has sense. This repo needs it own space because of how much special the data need to be on a production demo as experience ng.
